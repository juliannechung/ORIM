# ORIM
This repository contains MATLAB files for computing optimal regularized inverse matrices (ORIMs) and ORIM updates as described in the paper: 

Julianne Chung and Matthias Chung. Optimal Regularized Inverse Matrices for Inverse Problems, preprint, 2016.

# Requirements
These codes require the following packages:
         
         Regularization Tools package: Hansen. Regularization tools: A
             package for analysis and solution of discrete ill-posed 
             problems. Numerical Algorithms, 1994.
             
         RestoreTools package: Nagy, Palmer, and Perrone. Iterative 
             Methods for image deblurring: A Matlab object oriented 
             approach. Numerical Algorithms, 2004.
